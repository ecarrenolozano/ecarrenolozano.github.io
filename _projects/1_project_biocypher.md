[BioCypher](https://biocypher.org/) is an open-source framework that simplifies integrating biomedical data into graph databases. It provides a standardized, modular approach for building knowledge graphs in systems biology, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

Inspired by the Biocypher Ontology, it ensures compatibility with bioinformatics standards while allowing customization. BioCypher supports graph databases like Neo4j and promotes scalable, reproducible biomedical data analysis.
