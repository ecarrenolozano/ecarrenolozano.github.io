Engineer with experience in ASIC design, computer architecture, and large-scale data processing. In industry, he has contributed to developing data pipelines, supporting infrastructure decisions, and applying machine learning techniques for applications such as fraud detection. His academic work includes the design and implementation of an integrated circuit for data compression in the ALICE experiment at CERN, completed with a silicon tapeout in 130nm technology at TSMC. During his master’s studies, he focused on software engineering and deep learning, particularly in computer vision and inference under uncertainty, with both his bachelor’s and master’s theses earning the maximum grade.
